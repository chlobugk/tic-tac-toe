# tic-tac-toe
# ttt_any_size

This repo contains a tic tac toe app where you can choose to play a human, sequential AI, random AI, and an unbeatable AI. It was last updated to be able to pick and size board to play. So far that version is just human vs. human. You can run the app locally by running the ttt_app.rb.
